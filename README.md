Random algorithms and data structures implemented in Javascript, just for fun. 
Exploring different coding styles, so the coding style might differ greatly between files.

Implemented:
* Data structures:
	* Singly linked list
	* Doubly linked list
	* Stack - array based, fixed capacity
	* Stack - list based
	* Two-Stacks-One-Array
	* Queue - array based, bounded
	* Queue - list based
	* Queue - based on 2 stacks
	* Deque - array based
* Algorithms
	* Binary search - simple + generalized
	* Maximum subarray - divide and conquer solution, Kadene's algorithm
	* Array rotation

Ideas / todo:
* Stack - array based, unbounded
* Queue - array based, unbounded
* Deque - list based
* Queue - based on two stacks
* Heap
* Set
* Disjoint Set/UnionFind
* Binary Search Tree
* Graph and Graph algorithms
* Hash Table
* Bloom Filter
